# MailChimpSyncerSharp

Update your contacts in MailChimp to reflect a contact list from another source, for example a membership database.

The library supports tagging contacts and populating both the in-built merge fields (first name, last name, etc.) and custom merge fields that you've previously added in MailChimp.

For an example of how to use this library, see [MailChimpSyncerExampleApp/Program.cs](MailChimpSyncerExampleApp/Program.cs).
